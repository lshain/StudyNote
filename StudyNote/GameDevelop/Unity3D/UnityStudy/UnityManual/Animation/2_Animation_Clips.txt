====== 2 Animation Clips ======
Created 星期一 11 四月 2016

===== Animation Clips =====
Animation Clips are one of the core elements to Unity’s animation system. Unity supports importing animation from external sources, and offers the ability to create animation clips from scratch within the editor using the Animation window.

===== Animation from External Sources =====
Animation clips imported from external sources could include:

* Humanoid animations captured at a motion capture studio
* Animations created from scratch by an artist in an external 3D application (such as 3DS Max or Maya)
* Animation sets from 3rd-party libraries (eg, from Unity’s asset store)
* Multiple clips cut and sliced from a single imported timeline.

===== Animation Created and Edited Within Unity =====
Unity’s Animation Window also allows you to create and edit animation clips. These clips can animate:

* The position, rotation and scale of GameObjects
* Component properties such as material colour, the intensity of a light, the volume of a sound
* Properties within your own scripts including float, int, Vector and boolean variables
* The timing of calling functions within your own scripts
