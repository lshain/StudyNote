====== 2 Animation View Guide ======
Created 星期一 11 四月 2016

The Animation View in Unity allows you to create and modify Animation Clips directly inside Unity. It is designed to act as a powerful and straightforward alternative to external 3D animation programs. In addition to animating movement, the editor also allows you to animate variables of materials and components and augment your Animation Clips with Animation Events, functions that are called at specified points along the timeline.

See the pages about Animation import and Animation Scripting for further information about these subjects.

The rest of this section explains the different aspects of the Animation View.
