====== 5 Using Animation Events ======
Created 星期二 12 四月 2016

===== Using Animation Events =====

The power of animation clips can be increased by using Animation Events, which allow you to call functions in the object’s script at specified points in the timeline.

The function called by an animation event can optionally take one parameter. The parameter can be a float, string, int, object reference or an AnimationEvent object. The AnimationEvent object has member variables that allow a float, string, integer and object reference to be passed into the function all at once, along with other information about the event that triggered the function call.

// This C# function can be called by an Animation Event
public void PrintFloat (float theValue) {
	Debug.Log ("PrintFloat is called with a value of " + theValue);
}

You can add an animation event to a clip at the current playhead position by clicking the Event button or at any point in the animation by double-clicking the Event Line at the point where you want the event to be triggered. Once added, an event can be repositioned by dragging with the mouse. You can delete an event by selecting it and pressing Delete, or by right-clicking on it and selecting Delete Event from the contextual menu.

Animation Events are shown in the Event Line. Add a new Animation Event by double-clicking the Event Line or by using the Event button.

The Animation Event popup dialog lets you specify which function to call with which parameter value.

The events added to a clip are shown as markers in the event line. Holding the mouse over a marker will show a tooltip with the function name and parameter value.

Holding the mouse cursor over an Animation Event marker will show which function it calls as well as the parameter value.
